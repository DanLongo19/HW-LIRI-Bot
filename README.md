Overall: use node.js to get a song from spotify, movie info or concert details.

When you type in 'concert-this' plus a band or artist name you should get the information for their next show.

When you type in 'movie-this' and a movie name you will get information regarding that movie.

When you type in 'spotufy-this-song' and the name of a song, you should be getting that information back from spotify. I had this working initially, but got 20 song responses. When trying to narrow it down, like I was able to with movie and concert, I keep getting errors for Spotify. It looks like it has to do with my client id and secret, but I've confirmed mine match what I was given and am unsure how to fix this error at the moment. 

The app is functioning, minus spotify, and I will continue to try to troubleshoot.

I got some help in looking up how to limit the responses through Google searches using the '\n' to break up the responses and keep them in one console.log command.

Stay tuned on an update, but wanted to turn in on Saturday to make sure I got credit!
